The diff program made it really easy to see only what was different and not waste time looking at unchanged things.
It would make it easier to go back to a working version and not have to start again.
Auto will not be done at logical update times. It would make it very difficult to find usefull change levels.
Mutiple save for a commit  will give easier roll back to previuos code.
git log shows all the commits done.
diff does changed from commits.
Using git you can always go back to a working state if a change screws things up.
It would bwe nice to use git to make software without havint o always start over.
